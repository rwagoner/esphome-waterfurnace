# ESPHome WaterFurnace Aurora Component

ESPHome external component for WaterFurnace Aurora heat pumps. Communicates via the AID port using ModBus RTU with custom function codes over RS-485.

## Hardware

**Target board:** [Waveshare ESP32-S3-RS485-CAN](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-rs485-can.htm)
- ESP32-S3, 16MB flash
- RS-485 with hardware auto-direction control, TVS/ESD protection, 120 ohm termination (jumper)
- 7-36V DC input + USB-C

**RS-485 GPIO pins:**
| Signal | GPIO |
|--------|------|
| TX     | 17   |
| RX     | 18   |
| DE     | 21   |

The Waveshare board handles DE (direction enable) automatically via the ESP32-S3's UART RS-485 half-duplex mode. No `flow_control_pin` configuration is needed unless you're using a different board.

### AID Port Wiring (RJ-45, TIA-568-B)

| RJ-45 Pin | Wire Color    | Signal     |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| 1         | White-Orange  | RS-485 A+  |
| 2         | Orange        | RS-485 B-  |
| 3         | White-Green   | RS-485 A+  |
| 4         | Blue          | RS-485 B-  |
| 5-8       | -             | 24VAC (DO NOT CONNECT) |

**WARNING:** Pins 5-8 carry 24VAC. Do not connect these to data or ground lines. Doing so risks blowing the 3A fuse or damaging the ABC board.

### RS-485 Adapter Note

MAX485-based adapters are **not supported** due to poor auto-direction timing. The Waveshare ESP32-S3-RS485-CAN uses proper isolated RS-485 with hardware direction control.

## Requirements

- ESP32-S3 with RS-485 transceiver (Waveshare ESP32-S3-RS485-CAN recommended)
- ESPHome with ESP-IDF framework (for manual installs)

## Installation

### One-Click Web Install (Recommended)

Visit **[rwagoner.github.io/esphome-waterfurnace](https://rwagoner.github.io/esphome-waterfurnace/)** and click the Install button to flash firmware directly from your browser via USB. No ESPHome installation required.

After flashing, the device creates a **"WaterFurnace Fallback"** WiFi network. Connect to it and enter your WiFi credentials through the captive portal.

### ESPHome Dashboard Import

If you use the ESPHome Dashboard, adopt the device after it connects to your network. It will automatically import the configuration from this repository.

### Manual ESPHome Configuration

Reference this repository as a remote external component:

```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/rwagoner/esphome-waterfurnace
      ref: main
```

See `waterfurnace-esp32-s3.yaml` for a complete example configuration.

### Customizing (IZ2 Multi-Zone, etc.)

After adopting the device in the ESPHome Dashboard, you'll have a local YAML file that imports the base config via `packages:`. Add overrides directly in that file. For example, to configure IZ2 multi-zone, add additional climate entries:

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: waterfurnace
    name: "Zone 1"
    zone: 1
  - platform: waterfurnace
    name: "Zone 2"
    zone: 2
```

ESPHome merges list sections, so your additional entries are appended to the base config's climate list.

## Supported Features

### Climate
- Single zone and IZ2 multi-zone (up to 6 zones, auto-detected)
- Modes: Off, Heat, Cool, Auto (Heat/Cool), Emergency Heat (as Boost preset)
- Fan modes: Auto, Continuous, Intermittent
- Two-point setpoints (heating + cooling)

### Sensors
Temperature, pressure, power, current, humidity, compressor speed, waterflow, heat of extraction/rejection, and more.

### Binary Sensors
Compressor, blower, aux heat stages, reversing valve, lockout, alarm status from the system outputs register.

### Switches
DHW (Domestic Hot Water) enable/disable.

### Text Sensors
Model number, serial number, current fault code with description, system operating mode.

## Protocol

Uses ModBus RTU with WaterFurnace custom function codes:
- **Function 65:** Read multiple discontiguous register ranges
- **Function 66:** Read multiple discontiguous individual registers
- **Function 67:** Write multiple discontiguous registers

Communication: 19200 baud, 8 data bits, even parity, 1 stop bit. Slave address 1.

## Component Detection

On startup, the hub reads component status registers to detect installed equipment:
- Thermostat / AWL thermostat
- AXB (Advanced Extension Board) for performance and energy data
- IZ2 (IntelliZone 2) for multi-zone support
- VS Drive (Variable Speed compressor)

Polling groups are automatically configured based on detected components.

## Testing

Unit tests and integration tests are in `tests/`. The integration tests run the actual C++ protocol code against the [waterfurnace_aurora](https://github.com/ccutrer/waterfurnace_aurora) Ruby gem's ModBus server via Docker. See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for details.

```sh
# Unit tests (just needs g++)
cd tests && g++ -std=c++17 -I../components/waterfurnace -o test_protocol test_protocol.cpp ../components/waterfurnace/protocol.cpp && ./test_protocol

# Integration tests (needs Docker)
cd tests && docker compose up --build --abort-on-container-exit
```

## Development

### Local Development

For local development, create a `secrets.yaml` in the project root with your WiFi credentials, then use the dev config in `tests/`:

```sh
# Run all tests (unit, integration, config validation, compile)
tests/run_tests.sh

# Or compile and flash directly
cd tests && esphome run waterfurnace-dev.yaml
```

The `tests/waterfurnace-dev.yaml` overrides the component source to use local files via the `component_source` substitution.

### Testing CI Without a Release

1. Push to a branch and open a PR — the CI workflow builds both YAML files against ESPHome stable/beta/dev
2. From the Actions tab, manually trigger **Publish Firmware** via `workflow_dispatch` to test the firmware build pipeline without creating a release
3. To do a full end-to-end test, create a pre-release from your branch — this triggers firmware build + upload to that release + Pages redeploy

**Note:** GitHub Pages must be enabled in repo settings (Settings > Pages > Source: GitHub Actions).
